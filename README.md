This IdentityDemo came from Microsoft and Rick Anderson. You can find it way down deep in the ASP.Net Core docs.
https://github.com/aspnet/Docs/tree/master/aspnetcore/security/authentication/identity/sample/src/ASPNETCore-IdentityDemoComplete/IdentityDemo

This version upgrades it to dotnet core 2.1 and uses sqlite.
